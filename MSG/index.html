    <h1>Manvendra Singh Gohil</h1>

    <h2>Like a true royal who dedicates himself to the community, Manvendra Singh Gohil has been actively involved in raising awareness towards homosexuality and the implications of AIDS since the day he came out in public.
    
    Hailing from a very conservative state, Manvendra was disowned by his family in public for coming out in public.
    
    That didnâ€™t stop the Prince and he set up his own charity called Lakshya Foundation that works with homosexual men and the transgender community to promote safer sexual practices, despite often facing hindrances from the police.
    
    Manvendra and his charity made headlines again when they resorted to hanging condoms on trees, if at all that could bring more awareness towards having safe sex.</h2>
